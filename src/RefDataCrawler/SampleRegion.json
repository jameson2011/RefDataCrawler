  "description": "Little is known by the Empires about the region known as Insmother. Long a haunt of the Angel Cartel, it forms a tangled barrier between the dense south-eastern cluster and the barbed mystery of the Cache region. Once the guardian of a little-visited backwater volume, in the wake of the Spectrum Breach incident it now serves as the primary corridor between the southern expanse and the drone-infested eastern regions.",
